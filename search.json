Access my survey through this link.\n\n\nGoogle Trends\nFrom the Google Trends website, you can see the difference in overall election searches, Trump, and Harris search terms.\n\nHere, the 2020 election is the most popular, forming the maximum 100 value. Donald Trump’s popularity increases around the 2016 election and his presidency, then declines after he leaves office. Kamala Harris’s popularity is more minimal than either, with some increase after the launch of her presidential campaign.\n\n\nUsing the chart above, it is clear that in every state, Donald Trump takes up a larger percentage of searches than Kamala Harris.\n\nUsing ggtrends\nWith the ggtrends library, this data can also be summarized. Modeling total interest over time results in this graph:\n\nFrom this, it is also visible that the popularity for elections peaked much higher in 2020 than in other years. The package allows for more manipulation of data, including the combination of topics seen above, than the Google Trends website alone allows."

Access my survey through this link.\nIf you want it in a pdf form, click here.\nThe survey is structured in a linear format, with two skips available to avoid irrelevant questions for the user. The questionnaire is for distribution by a movie rental company to their customers. The questions have no clear order, but the most important information to the company appears to come first in the survey. Creating more skips for irrelevant questions and reordering the questions would be beneficial. This would make it such that if someone does not own a DVD player in question 3, they do not have to answer again in question 10."

Here are some of the many tasks I performed while with them:\n\nPublishing an Article\n\nWhile working at NCSL, I was lucky enough to help out with many projects and tasks. One of those was the opportunity to publish a summary article of a brief by Andrew Smalley, who I interned under. This covers some of the recent efforts done by states to make more efficient workforce systems.\n\n\nTracking Postsecondary Legislation\nMy primary task working at NCSL was to track and categorize state legislation for higher education and workforce efforts. I tracked around 2000 pieces of legislation in topic areas ranging from dual enrollment to financial aid. Look through the legislation below:\n\n\n\nLook through legislation here!\n\n\n\n\nStudent Loan Database\n\n\n\n\nLook through Student Loan Legislation here!\n\n\nOne other database I tracked legislation for as an intern was our Student Loan Bill Tracking Database. This takes the legislation passed and categorizes it further in a Power BI database to break down forgiveness, licensure, oversight, and tax bills into their own groupings. Check it out!"

It’s used to arrange words ideologically, especially in politics. It’s based on the frequency of the words used and their frequency in relation to other words and assumes a single-dimension to words and that users with such beliefs use the words more frequently. It generates a roughly curved graph that looks like a fishtail, hence the name."

This is also consistent with the expected idea that most videos are not viral.\nBecause of the restrictions on queries, I could not use comment data thoroughly.
